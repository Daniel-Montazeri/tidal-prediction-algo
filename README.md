# Tidal Prediction Algo

In this project, we used the Fast Fourier transform algorithm to predict tides in Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada. We compared our results with predictions from a programmed analog tidal prediction machine inspired by Lord Kelvin's work. We used cross-correlation and power spectrum analysis to compare the two predictions. Overall, we found that both of the predictions matched the actual data quite well.
